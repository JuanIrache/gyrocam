# gyrocam

Processing sketch for working with GoPro metadata (Hero5 and beyond), previously extracted using my GPMD2CSV tool http://tailorandwayne.com/GPMD2CSV.zip (Source: https://github.com/JuanIrache/gopro-utils )

It can mostly work with IMU (accelerometer+gyroscope) data, adapt it to the framerate and individual frames, print the data and stabilise the video, or output it to csv for use in After Effects.

It was created specifically for this project: https://youtu.be/bg8B0Hl_au0 (Data+Stabilisation)

So it can certainly be improved, maybe turned into a library and include work with the GPS data.
